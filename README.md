## Subject Of Project
Foody App is a mobile app project where you can order food. In this app, people can order different foods from different restaurants. People can view the meal details, choose the amount of food and add them to the cart. All foods added to cart are listed on the card detail screen. People can see the total price of the items in their cart and they can go to the payment section. If the payment section is completed, the order preparation animation will open. This means that the order transaction was successful.
